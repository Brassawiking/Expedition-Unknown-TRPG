# Expedition Unknown - TRPG 
A tabletop Role-playing game puts you in the shoes of scientists or scholars on an expedition into the unknown while being escorted and protected by military or the kingsguards.

For this rule guide, a contemperary sci-fi setting will be used as basis, but it can easily be changed to match any other settings.

## Character creation

### Stats
There are 5 stats that are used to describe the overall strength and weakness of a character:

- Expertise _(How well you can exert your expertise, lower means greater risk of mistakes)_
- Stress _(How well you can work under pressure and extreme situations)_
- Able _(How well you can handle yourself, lower means higher reliance on others)_
- Social _(How well you interact with others, higher means better chance of giving orders, etc)_
- Motivation _(How motivated you are at being on the expedition)_

Every stat can have a value of 1-5. When a skill check is done, you will roll a 1d6 against your stat and will have to roll equal or lower than your stat value. (Stat of 3 -> 1, 2, 3 = success). This means that rolling a value of 6 is always a failed dice. When you have advantage, you roll and extra dice and choose the lowest. If you have disadvantage you roll an extra dice and choose the highest.

To determine your stats you go through all of them one by one and roll 2d20. For each dice, a value of 1-5 gives you a -1 stat trait, 6-15 a 0 stat trait, 16-20 a +1 stat trait. Summarize all traits for each stat and add their sum to 3 which is the base value of every stat.

*Example:*

- Stat = 3 (base) + 0 (first dice rolled 11) + -1 (second dice rolled 3) = 2

### Traits
A trait is coupled directly to a certain stat. A negative trait (-1) is something that affects your character stat negatively in general, but may add advantage/disadvantage in certain situations. A neutral trait (0) will not affect the stat but may add advantage/disadvantage in certain situations. A positive trait (+1) affects the stat positivly in general but may add advantage/disadvantage in certain situaions.

*Example:*

- Stress = 3 (base) + -1 (first dice rolled 2 -> "Scaredy cat") + 1 (second dice rolled 17 -> "Yoga instructor") = 3

### Choosing traits
Traits can either be chosen using a predetermined table, or the player can make them up freely as long as they match the negative / neutral / positive aspect. If the tables does not match the campaign setting (e.g. a fantasy expedition into forgotten ruins), feel free to come up with your own tables!

_DISCLAIMER_

Assigning a trait as a negative stat reducing trait may be perceived as a judgement of real people having this trait in real life. The traits are only intended to give your character a fast backstory and description and also given them an extra gameplay dynamic. It is by no means a statement against anyone to be perceived as lesser. So if you do not accept how a predetermined trait table has been setup, feel free to change around however you like, swap or replace any traits you disagree with or are uncomfortable with.

### Choosing specialization
A character specialization is the reason why they have been selected as a candidate and is their unique expertise that they bring to the expedition. This can be used to give advantage on skill checks but could also enable actions that would require a dedicated team and more time to do. A player may roll for a random specialization or choose freely.
